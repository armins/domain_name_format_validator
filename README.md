domain_name_validator
=====================

Ever needed to validate a domain name? This gem will validate any normalized
domain name. A normalized domain name is either a standard domain name in
UTF-8, or an international domain name that has been normalized to UTF-8.

NOTE: This code is not yet fully functional. When it is, it will be released
as a gem via RubyGems.org.
